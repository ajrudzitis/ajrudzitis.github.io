"Always seeking pleasant sounds and sights, agreeable smells, delicious tastes, and pleasant sensations of the body. The endless seeking of momentary, fragmentary pleasures. We are attracted to them as if they will solve our problems, as if they will bring an end to suffering. We live our lives waiting for the next two-week vacation, the next relationship, some new object to 'own': waiting with desire for some new happiness always just out of reach." - Joseph Goldstein
