"Like children playing with toys in a burning house, we do not like to look at the pain and suffering in our lives. We put the old and sick away in homes so we don't have to see their sorrow. We chase beggars off the street so we don't see the affliction of poverty. We dress up corpses as if they were going to a party, never confronting the face of death. The first noble truth is the truth of suffering. It does no good to pretend that it does not exist. No matter how we obscure it, the body is going to get old and diseased. It is going to die. No matter how many distractions we are entertained with, there will be anger and ill will and frustration and anxiety and tension. We burn with anger, burn with desire." - Joseph Goldstein
