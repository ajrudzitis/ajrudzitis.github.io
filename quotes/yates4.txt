"It is especially important not to be deceived by mere intellectual understanding. You may think you "got it" just by reading this description. However, many philosophers and scientists have understood this truth intellectually, but it hasn't transformed them. We haven't gotten it until this Insight completely transforms the way we perceive the world-especially during challenging times, like when we're in an argument with our boss or partner, in a traffic jam, or when our house burns down."
