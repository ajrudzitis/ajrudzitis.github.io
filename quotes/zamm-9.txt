"We arrive at the turnoff to Crater Lake and go up a neat road into the National Park-clean, tidy and preserved. It really shouldn't be any other way, but this doesn't win any prizes for Quality either. It turns it into a museum. This is how it was before the white man came-beautiful lava flows, and scrawny trees, and not a beer can anywhere-but now that the white man is here, it looks fake. Maybe the National Park Service should set just one pile of beer cans in the middle of all that lava and then it would come to life. The absence of beer cans is distracting."
