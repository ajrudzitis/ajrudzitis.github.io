"This idea in the back of your mind that your life would be much better if you could just eliminate a few of the worst things is an endless trap. If you continue to let this idea stay in your thoughts it will certainly continue to make you unhappy, for it can never come true, and if you think about it for a moment you will be forced to admit this. Your world, at least your world as it stands now, is like this patch of thorns, and no amount of wishing can make it a bed of soft grass." - Excerpt from "The Garden" by Geshe Michael Roach
