"Just as a young pregnant woman would consider the well-being of her baby while going about her activities-protecting it from harm while she worked, thinking of it while sitting, considering its nourishment while eating-a wise meditator will guard the meditation object in all activities and at all times." - Wisdom Wide and Deep by Shaila Catherine
