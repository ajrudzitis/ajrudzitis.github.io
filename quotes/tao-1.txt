Tao called Tao is not Tao. 

Names can name no lasting name. 

Nameless: the origin of heaven and earth. 
Naming: the mother of ten thousand things. 

Empty of desire, perceive mystery. 
Filled with desire, perceive manifestations. 

These have the same source, but different names. 
Call them both deep-Deep and again deep: The gateway to all mystery.

- Tao Te Ching
