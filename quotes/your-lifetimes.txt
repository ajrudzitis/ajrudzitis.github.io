"Here is something true: one day you will be dead. 

Here is something false: you only live once.

It takes about 7 years to master something. If you live to be 88, after age 11, you have 11 opportunities to be great at something.

These are your lifetimes. Most people never let themselves die. 

Some are afraid of death. Some think they are already ghosts. But you have many lives. 

Spend a life writing poems.

Spend another building things.

Spend a life looking for facts.

And another looking for truth.

These are your lifetimes. Use them."
