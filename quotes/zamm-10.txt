"Quality is the continuing stimulus which causes us to create the world in which we live. All of it. Every last bit of it. Religion isnâ€™t invented by man. Men are invented by religion. Men invent responses to Quality, and among these responses is an understanding of what they themselves are."

- Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance
