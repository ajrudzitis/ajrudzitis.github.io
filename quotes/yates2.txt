"All we can ever observe is the mental object, a product of the mind itself-not the source of the original stimulus. To put it another way, the 'thing-in-itself' that stimulated the mind to produce the object can never be observed. The mind creates its own 'reality,' made entirely of cognitive-emotional constructs produced in response to unknown, and ultimately unknowable, 4 forces acting on the mind through the senses."
