My heart is a window, 
my heart is a slide.

My heart can be closed,
or opened up wide.

Some days it's a puddle.
Some days it's a stain.
Some days it is cloudy and heavy with rain.

Some days it is tiny,
but tiny can grow...
and grow...
and grow.

There are days it's a fence between me and the world,
days it's a whisper that can barely be heard.

There are days it is broken,
but broken can mend,
and a heart that is closed can still open again.

My heart is a shadow,
a light, and a guide.

Closed or open...
I get to decide.
