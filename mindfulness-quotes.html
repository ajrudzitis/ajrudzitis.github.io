                    you gotta do it every day – that’s the hard part. But it 
                    does get easier."

                    "Like children playing with toys in a burning house, we do
                    not like to look at the pain and suffering in our lives. 
                    We put the old and sick away in homes so we don't have to 
                    see their sorrow. We chase beggars off the street so we 
                    don't see the affliction of poverty. We dress up corpses as
                    if they were going to a party, never confronting the face 
                    of death. The first noble truth is the truth of suffering. 
                    It does no good to pretend that it does not exist. No 
                    matter how we obscure it, the body is going to get old and 
                    diseased. It is going to die. No matter how many 
                    distractions we are entertained with, there will be anger 
                    and ill will and frustration and anxiety and tension. We 
                    burn with anger, burn with desire."

                    "Sensory events are like a lake. Awareness is like a 
                    flashlight. <br/><br/>

                    The surface of the water represents the part of sensory 
                    event that’s conscious. The water just below the surface 
                    represents the parts of the sensory event that are 
                    peripherally conscious. The mid-depth water represents 
                    sub-conscious neural processing. The water at the bottom 
                    of the lake represents unconscious neural processing.<br/><br/>

                    Directing the flashlight towards a spot on the surface of 
                    the lake effects all four levels simultaneously. <br/><br/>

                    What’s on the surface becomes much clearer than it 
                    ordinarily is. What’s just below now becomes as clear as 
                    the surface had been. What was subconscious now becomes 
                    peripherally conscious. What was utterly unconscious now 
                    becomes somewhat conscious. <br/><br/>

                    Thus the subconscious/unconscious levels of processing get 
                    to know themselves a bit better. You (the observer 
                    directing the flashlight) still cannot directly see all 
                    levels but some photons of clarity have trickled down, 
                    giving those levels what they need to untie their own 
                    knots. <br/><br/>

                    It’s quite common for people to report that during formal 
                    practice, nothing much seems to happen. Yet they notice 
                    spontaneous and permanent improvements in perception and 
                    behavior in daily life. The penetration (or trickle down) 
                    paradigm described here is one way to explain why that 
                    happens." <br/><br/>

                    Siddhartha listened. He was now nothing but a listener, 
                    completely concentrated on listening, completely empty, he 
                    felt, that he had now finished learning to listen. Often 
                    before, he had heard all this, these many voices in the 
                    river, today it sounded new. Already, he could no longer 
                    tell the many voices apart, not the happy ones from the 
                    weeping ones, not the ones of children from those of men, 
                    they all belonged together, the lamentation of yearning 
                    and the laughter of the knowledgeable one, the scream of 
                    rage and the moaning of the dying ones, everything was 
                    one, everything was intertwined and connected, entangled a 
                    thousand times. And everything together, all voices, all 
                    goals, all yearning, all suffering, all pleasure, all that 
                    was good and evil, all of this together was the world. All 
                    of it together was the flow of events, was the music of 
                    life. And when Siddhartha was listening attentively to 
                    this river, this song of a thousand voices, when he 
                    neither listened to the suffering nor the laughter, when 
                    he did not tie his soul to any particular voice and 
                    submerged his self into it, but when he heard them all, 
                    perceived the whole, the oneness, then the great song of 
                    the thousand voices consisted of a single word, which was 
                    Om: the perfection.
