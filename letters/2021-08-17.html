            Hello Friends,
        </p>
        <p>
            A few nights each week, when Amelia goes to bed early enough, I spend my time among the trees in our back yard. It has been such a dry summer that I’ve taken to watering them, soaking the ground under each tree for a length of time. Between moving the hose, I’ve been practicing my guitar (hopefully not angering the neighbors too much). And when my fingers hurt to much from that, a little ukulele. 
        </p>

            Speaking of guitar, I’ve also started taking lessons once a week at the Seattle Drum School. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m terrible at it, but I like it all the same.

            Amelia is attending half-day daycare now. We drop her off at 9 am and pick her up at 1 pm. She moved quickly past “I don’t want to stay” to “I don’t want to leave.” The daycare itself is in a residential area, with lots of time spent outside, in the open air. She even manages to keep her mask on most of the time. And she gets along well with the teachers and other children. 
        </p>

            Besides that, not much has happened. It has been a quiet summer. I’m seeing more friends than last year. Looking forward to a trip to Minnesota in a couple of weeks. It will be Amelia’s first flight as a toddler (and with opinions). 
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope you all are getting through it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Until next time,
        </p>
        <p>
