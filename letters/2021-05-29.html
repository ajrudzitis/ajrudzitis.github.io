            Hey all,
        </p>
        <p>
            I’ve always loved the smell of lilacs in Spring. When I first set out to write this letter, the cool evenings in my neighborhood always smelled of lilacs. But that time has now passed.

            We’re all slowly becoming accustomed to life with fewer masks; where concern over catching the virus is replaced with anxiety over trying to understand the mask conventions that are being followed wherever it is we are.

            Everyone in the household is two weeks past their second dose of Pfizer or Moderna (except, of course, Amelia). We let down our guard when paddle boarding; when socializing with neighbors. We’ve started to feel comfortable with eating at restaurants again, if they’re not too crowded. I’ve socialized with my family without thinking about distance or masking. I’ve been doing yoga twice a week (in studio, with no mask!) And I am looking forward to attending an outdoor barbecue with some vaccinated friends this weekend. 
        </p>

            We still wear masks at the park. And when grocery shopping. And when picking up food. But it is starting to feel like a return to normalcy.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m also starting to consider that the ideal amount of mask wearing isn’t zero. Masks on public transit feels like it makes sense? Especially during winter.

            Amelia is doing well. Her new favorite phrases are “I like it!”, “I don’t like it!”, and “[I’ll] do it [my] self!” Adhesive bandages have acquired the magic ability to heal any pain. I think we go through about 5 a day. And she has gone from being afraid of bugs to actively looking for them under rocks.

            For myself, I picked up my old guitar from high school. I struggled with it for a bit. A very talented friend of a friend made some adjustments to it, and now for the first time in the 17 years that I’ve had it, it feels like my guitar. That’s not to say I can do anything that resembles playing it, but the baby steps I am taking are enjoyable. And because of the Music Theory for Dummies book I picked up, everything I am doing comes with a level of understanding that was missing from the first time around.  
        </p>
        <p>
            That’s all for now.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Take care and be safe,
        </p>
        <p>
