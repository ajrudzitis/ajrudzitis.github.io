Last weekend we spent part of the day at Seattle Center to visit BrickCon (Seattle's own Lego festival). But this story isn't about Lego.

On the way back to the monorail, we passed a man making balloon animals. We stopped to get one for Amelia. 

While making Amelia the flower she requested, he looked at me and (obviously pregnant) Yuling. "I know what you're going through," he said. "You love the one you have so much that you wonder how you will possibly have enough love for the next one. But you will. Your hearts will grow big enough for both of them, and then you will wonder how one was ever enough."

Amelia enjoyed her balloon flower.
