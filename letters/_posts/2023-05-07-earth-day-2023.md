title:  "Earth Day 2023"

Amelia's preschool celebrated Earth Day by taking a walk with the kids to pick up garbage around the neighborhood. This inspired Amelia to want to do the same around our neighborhood. This picture is from the start of our trip, but the bag was quite full by the time we finished.

The kids are doing quite well. 

This is the time of year our outdoor spaces become more attractive, so we have been spending a lot more time out in our yard and around the block. Amelia is particularly fond of collecting "nature" and putting it into little containers. She loves pinecones and rocks the most, and we have little tubs of them scattered around the outside of the house. 

She is also very keen on planting seeds. I expect in a month or so, there will be a lot of random poppies sprouting up around our house.

Little Jonny is also making large strides (though not literally quite yet). We placed him on his play mat a few days ago, and turned around for a moment to find he was scooting his way across the floor. Not exactly crawling, but he has some mobility now.

Besides taking care of the children, we're starting to dip our toes into the next phase of our new home project. We have engaged the services of an architect to start looking at what we could build on the property we acquired. I expect it will be over a year though before we actually break ground on any project. However, here are some things I'm looking forward to having in a new home:

- Modern insulation
- A utility sink
- Proper wiring for networking built in
- Enough outlets to plug things in

I am wrapping up my last few weeks at work before I trade places with Yuling and head out on parental leave. I will be back at work sometime in August. If you're in the area during the summer, and open to taking a morning off, I would love to have a walk around park with you and my smallest one.

That's all for now!

Cheers,
