Jonny’s happy place is the changing table next to his window. (At least, when he is with me, the parent unable to produce fresh milk.)

I put him here just for changes, but then he looks so comfortable and he becomes so calm I’m inclined to let him hang out for a bit. On this occasion we had placed him for some tummy time (something which Amelia hated) and he promptly fell asleep. 

Amelia came in and asked “what is he dreaming about?”

Looking out the window, it is both grey and green.

The winter here is defined by darkness and grey skies. But the green of many kinds of trees, as well as the plentiful moss, stands guard against the encroaching monochrome. 

And there is life. Though it retreats from the gardens and leafy trees, it’s presence can still be found in the scent of decaying leaves that fills the air outside.

Jonny and I both look out the window. I can’t help but smile.
