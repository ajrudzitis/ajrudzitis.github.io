Hello Everyone! 

It has been a while. Allow me to compress the last 5 months into some rapid fire updates:

**Me**

Back in December, 2019, I left my role at Amazon to join Stripe. Later this month I will be returning to Amazon to work once again for AWS Cryptography. The reason I’ve decided to switch back will be its own extended retrospective that I will leave for another time.

I’m taking some time off before I start my new role on July 22nd. If you’re free on a weekday, let’s hang out. 

I have my own personal time off bucket list that I’m working my way through; museums, friends, books, and some long walks. 

**Amelia**

We were floored back in April when we learned Amelia was accepted to [UCDS](https://www.ucds.org/) for Kindergarten. She really loved her PreK experience at Villa Academy, and is heartbroken to leave some of her friends behind. However, the opportunities she will have academically at UCDS are unparalleled and it was too big of an opportunity to miss. We’re really proud of her and are excited to join the community there. 

In the meantime, Amelia continues to practice the violin. She recently played an amazing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star in her first recital. 

She also really loves riding her bike and has recently picked up roller skating as well.

**Jonny**

Jonny will be starting preschool in August at [UTCS](https://www.utcs.org/). He has been at home since we gave up on daycare back in November, being looked after by Yuling’s generous mother and a couple of part time nannies. 

At home, Jonny is a boy of few words and many ideas. He loves playing with Brio trains, blocks, and pushing a scooter around the back yard. 

**Everyone**

We are continuing to make slow progress on our hopefully forever home in View Ridge. We settled on a concept with our architect and builder that seems to fit our requirements and budget, but due to taking so long to make up our minds, we need to find a new architect. 

That is all from the trenches. I hope to see you all sometime. 

Cheers, 

Aleks
