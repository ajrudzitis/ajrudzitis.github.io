title: "Through the Trees"
---

**I**: The birdsong is more pervasive this year. More penetrating. I don't know if this reflects an external or internal change. 

**II**: I am walking in Discovery Park. At every bench I encounter, I stop to read a little bit of [_The Timeless Way of Building_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Timeless_Way_of_Building) by Christopher Alexander. I also jot down any stray thought.

**III**: Am I a programmer that likes walks or a walker that sometimes programs?

**IV**: Work agitates the pond. Stirs up the mud. This lets it settle. 

**V**: I didn't touch grass. I prefer looking up through the trees.

**VI**: The difference between being an adult and being a child is whether anyone will shout "that's far enough." 

On the way home, I listened to [my new summer jam playlist](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX8Cb57RCMBwyOVuXg06rGi2T0mSu8Hb7&si=YQXvqPHXZdp6n0c5).
