title: "Amazing Children's Books"

Happy New Year!

As a follow up to my list of awesome things from 2022, I wanted to share something I've been wanting to put together for some time: a walk through of some of the best children's literature I have found to date. 

Since Amelia was born, I've arrived at the understanding that much of children's literature is, in fact, simply amazing literature. Making something longer, with bigger words and no pictures, does not imbue something with superiority, and the words and stories of many of Amelia's picture books stand shoulder to shoulder with the best of the adult literature I've read. 

Here is what I've discovered so far:

# The inspirational work of Corinna Luyken

> There are days it's a fence between me and the world,
> 
> days it's a whisper that can barely be heard.
> 
> 
> There are days it is broken,
> 
> but broken can mend,
> 
> and a heart that is closed 
> 
> can still open again.
> 
> 
> - _My Heart_

_My Heart_ was the first book I purchased by Corinna Luyken. I was initially drawn to her unique style of illustration which combined ink and pencil. _My Heart_ is an illustrated poem of the various ways we may feel, and hope that we both recognize the present while being open to change. 

> Do you see --
> 
> how with each mistake
> 
> she is becoming?
> 
> 
> - _The Book of Mistakes_

_The Book of Mistakes_ is a story of few words, relying on pictures instead to show how many tiny mistakes add up to something wonderful.

> The tree in me
> 
> is strong.
> 
> 
> It bends,  
> 
> and has roots that go deep ...
> 
> down to where 
> 
> other roots reach up 
> 
> toward their own 
> 
> trunk-branch-crown
> 
> and sky too.
> 
> 
> - _The Tree in Me_

_The Tree in Me_ has perhaps my favorite illustrations of all the books on this list. Corinna expands upon her style from _My Heart_ and adds vivid oranges, blues and browns to tell a story about the dynamic life that connects us all. 

# The absurdist world of Mac Barnett and Jon Klassen

> "A sculptor shapes blocks into art," said Circle.
> 
> "Ah, yes," said Square. "I see what you mean."
> 
> But he did not really see what she meant.
> 
> 
> - _Square_

I am really not sure how to describe *The Shapes Trilogy*. It just sort of is. There are three books, Square, Circle, and Triangle. Three characters with distinct personalities that come across in an incredible few lines. _Square_ my favorite, and you could read it as commentary on the meaning of art and work. 

Jon Klassen also wrote and illustrated _This Is Not My Hat_ which is about a fish, the hat that is not his, and what happens when its owner turns up. 

# The Zen meditations of Jon Muth

> "I guess bad guys don't always think they are being bad guys," said Leo.
> 
> "That is our struggle," said Stillwater. "Thinking if we get all the best things for ourselves, we will be happier."
> 
> 
> - _Zen Socks_

There is a whole series of books which follow the adventures of a friendly panda named Stillwater, and the children he befriends in the neighborhood: _Zen Shorts_, _Zen Ties_, _Zen Ghosts_, and _Zen Socks_. As the titles imply, Jon is influenced by Zen Buddhist fables and lessons. 

> "But I understand now," she said.
> 
> "The medicine was for me, wasn't it?"
> 
> 
> Stillwater smiled a beautiful sad smile.
> 
> 
> - _Addy's Cup of Sugar_

_Addy's Cup of Sugar_ is a sort of special-feature of his _Zen_ series of books. It is a book about loss and grief in the form of a modern adaptation of the story of [Kisa Gotami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kisa_Gotami), one of the most famous stories out of Buddhist literature. I haven't read this one to Amelia, but I have it up on a high shelf for when the time is right. 

# The many perspectives of Brendan Wenzel

> The cat knew them all, and they all knew the cat. 
> 
> 
> - _They All Saw A Cat_

Brendan Wenzel specializes in stories that show how a simple thing can look so differerent, depending on your perspective. In _They All Saw A Cat_, he shows us how different animals interpret the presence of a house cat based on the limitations of their senses and their view of the world. 

In another one of his books, _A Stone Sat Still_ (which I have not yet read), Brendan shows how a simple stone changes with the passing of time and the seasons. 

All phenomena have a transient nature; and arising and passing. 

# The past and future dreams of Livia Blackburne

> I dream with Popo as she rocks me in her arms. She sings, "Beibei xin, beibei gan." In my heart I hear: My baby, my heart. My baby, my love.
> 
> 
> - _I Dream of Popo_

I tear up every time with this one. I had a very special relationship with my grandmother, as Amelia does with hers. While this book is a reflection of one particular culture, the relationship it depicts transcends.

That's all for now! Life is otherwise good. Jonny is growing strong and Amelia is ready to head back to her preschool from winter break. If I didn't have a chance to see you over the last few weeks, I hope you enjoyed your holidays.

(Also, future newsletters will be less listy.)

Take care,

Aleks
