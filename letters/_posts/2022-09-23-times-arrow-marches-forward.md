Time’s Arrow Marches Forward
===

Hey, so, first things first, let's do the news. 
 
This is sort of embarrassing, and for those that don't already know, I'm really sorry for not bringing it up sooner. [0]
 
Yuling and I are having another child! Like really soon! Actually, Yuling is having one, but I promised to at least watch. And offer some words of encouragement. And of course, raise them.
 
Anyway, here are the facts:
* It’s a boy.
* Expected due date is November 23rd.
* Yuling is well and everything is generally going well.
* Yes, Amelia is very excited to be a big sister.
* No, we don’t need anything. [1][2]
* I’m not sure what we’re going to do with the baby shower decorations which have been up since Amelia’s  baby shower. Before they were just old; now they’re misleading because it says “girl” instead of “boy”. 
 
So that’s happening and we’re all happy and excited. 
 
In the mean time, we’ve done some other things. 
 
At the end of August we went to Hawaii for a bit. Amelia was surprisingly good on the airplane in both directions.

Things we did:
* Lots of swimming in the pool followed by lots of swimming in the ocean.
* Toured a submarine. 
* I had my first ever surfing lesson.[3] 
* Rode a real historic train.
* Rode a fake historic train.
* Went aboard a WWII submarine. 
* Ate lots of papaya.

Besides that, things have been quiet. Amelia continues to enjoy her daycare, though with things returning back to pre-pandemic norms, the childhood diseases are making up for lost time. 
 
That’s all for now. 
 
Cheers and stay safe!
 
Aleks o.b.o. the family
 
[0] I mean, I told LinkedIn before you. 

[1] Seriously, we don’t need anything. 

[2] In fact, could you take some things to Goodwill for us?

[3] Between surfing and the guitar, I’m really building up my midlife crisis war chest.
