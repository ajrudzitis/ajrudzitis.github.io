            Hi.
        </p>
        <p>
            I mentioned in my last letter <a href="https://tinyletter.com/aleksrudzitis/letters/a-second-draft">https://tinyletter.com/aleksrudzitis/letters/a-second-draft</a> that I had been stuck for some time on the contents of said letter. However, I omitted some of how I became unstuck.

        <p>
            In my dream, I was joining a group of protesters marching through Seattle toward Cal Anderson Park. A group of us, numbering a few hundred, were walking up Pike Street when we came upon a police barricade placed in our path. A few dozen police stood about 30 yards further up the hill, beginning to don riot gear. The group I was with amassed against the barricade while we waited for what felt like would be an inevitable confrontation with the police.
        </p>
        <p>
            A young black man standing near to me turned toward me and asked “why are you here?” 
        </p>
        <p>
            I began trying to articulate the importance of these protests, and what it meant to me.
        </p>
        <p>
            He shook his head. “No. Why are you here?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Not knowing why my answer was not accepted, I tried again to put into words my feelings about injustices and inequality.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Bullshit! Why are you here?!”
        </p>
        <p>
            I tried again. Thinking about what I saw happen to George Floyd. To others. To protesters in Seattle. I tried to put it into words. 
        </p>
        <p>
            “STOP!” Again he interrupted me. “Any moment the police are going to start firing tear gas canisters. DO YOU KNOW WHY YOU’RE HERE?!”
        </p>
        <p>
            This time, without thinking, I answered with the first thoughts that entered my mind: 
        </p>
        <p>
            “I don’t know. I’m scared. I love my daughter.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The young man relaxed, seemingly satisfied with my answer. He handed me a mask, told me to stay safe, and disappeared into the crowd.
        </p>
        <p>
            The dream ended shortly after when the sound of gun shots came from the direction of the police. I woke up with the sensation of electricity flowing through my arms.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The dream reminded me of a koan; a short story, dialog, or question used to provoke the mind during Zen practice. If you’ve ever heard the question “what is the sound of one hand clapping?”, then you know a koan. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Koans are questions or ideas that cannot be understood with the conceptual mind. Koans test our ability to see beyond a world of duality and concepts. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I’ve been continuously reflecting on my dream, wondering if my final answer also pointed at something that exists beyond concepts. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope that my Zen teacher visits my dreams again. 
        </p>
        <p>
            And I promise my next letter will be a more mundane update on life. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Until then, stay safe.
