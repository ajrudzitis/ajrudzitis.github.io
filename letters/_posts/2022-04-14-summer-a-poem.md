Summer (A poem)
===

_Written April 7th, 2022. Published April 14th, 2022_

Today I smelled summer.

It smelled like a seventy degree evening with a touch of haze in the air.

And the lingering smell of two barbecues on my walk home.

And a breath of lilac.

With Ed Sheeran’s “Bad Habits” in my earbuds.

The version with Bring Me The Horizon slaps.
