title:  "In case the other one breaks..."
---

Amelia has a recent obsession with redundancy. 

"Why did you put away one of your socks?" "In case the other one breaks."

"Why did you take out two masks?" "In case the other one breaks."

"Why did you get two cups of ketchup?" "In case the other runs out."

It's honestly a refreshing departure from all they "why" questions. It feels like she is starting to build her own hypotheses for why things are the way they are in the world. 

Oh, and her understanding of why we decided to have two kids? In case the other one breaks.

In other Amelia news, I took her skiing for the first time at Stevens Pass. 

We had to go mid-week because the place that I merely remember being expensive and crowded during the weekend growing up, now feels nearly impossible to get into to. 

She took to it well and is excited to go again.

The application process continues for Pre-K at some of the independent schools in the area. Amelia currently attends a half-day preschool program, which we really enjoy, but her current energy levels tell us she is ready for a full day program. We are looking for places where we hope she would be able to continue into Kindergarten. 

Applications and essays were completed back in December. This month is all about interviews, both us as parents and for Amelia. For Amelia, that effectively means free play dates on the weekends, which is nice. 

Results come out in April.

Jonny is doing very well. He is smiling a lot. He has discovered his hands and is just beginning to interact with objects. 

He sleeps as well as can be expected and has a big appetite.

He is also a big boy. Though he is not even 3 months yet, we're on to 6-12 month onesies.

Yuling is still on maternity leave until May (at which point I will take the balance of my parental leave, meaning we'll have at least one stay at home parent through August.) I am impressed beyond words at Yuling's ability to not only take care of Jonny but to also use the opportunity to fill out Amelia's after school schedule with activities like soccer, music, math and reading tutoring, and swimming lessons. I have genuine anxiety that I won't be half as good of a stay at home parent when it is turn for my leave.

That is all for now. I hope everyone is well. Until next timeâ€¦
