            The small, seemingly inconsequential expectations we set for ourselves,<br/>
            others, and our environment are, more often than not, destined not to<br/>
            be met. Yet, when we make them almost without thinking, how can we<br/>
            escape the hurt our missed expectations cause?
        </p>

        <p>
            I would like to relate a personal anecdote of how three simple words,<br/>
            heard at the right moment, forever reshaped how I react to the world<br/>
            around me.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My wife and I were returning from a short vacation. During our absence,<br/>
            we had left our home and our cat in the care of a relative. We returned<br/>
            to find the house was intact. The cat, fed. But the instructions I had<br/>
            left did not provide guidance on when to let the cat out. The<br/>
            instructions also did not say the litter box should be cleaned.
        </p>

        <p>
            The litter wasn’t cleaned. And the cat never let out. I was upset.
        </p>

        <p>
            I was upset that the litter box had not been cleaned for almost a week. I<br/>
            was upset that our cat had no choice but to use the filthy litter box. And<br/>
            I was upset that the person we had entrusted with the care of our beloved<br/>
            animal had not noticed the problem.
        </p>

        <p>
            “He should have known.”
        </p>


        <p>
            That’s what I felt. And that is what I repeatedly vented to my wife. It was<br/>
            in response to my frustration that she uttered the words that forever<br/>
            altered the lens through which I viewed life.
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>“Should doesn’t matter.”</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            Those words lifted a burden from my shoulders that I didn’t even realize I was<br/>
            carrying.
        </p>

        <p>
            My frustration, my suffering in that moment was caused only by my clinging to<br/>
            what “should have” been. There was no external cause. I was holding on to a<br/>
            vision of the present that did not exist and would not exist no matter how<br/>
            frustrated I felt. The clinging I felt was so much a part of me that only<br/>
            in the absence of such clinging I became aware that it was ever there at all.
        </p>

        <p>
            Relief from suffering required only one thing: to let go.
        </p>

        <p>
            I began to see how my sense of expectation permeated my everyday experience.<br/>
            “They should have held the door open.” “They shouldn’t have cut me off<br/>
            in traffic.” “They should not have taken the last cup of coffee.” “I<br/>
            shouldn’t have said that.”
        </p>

        <p>
            Well, that’s not what happened.
        </p>

        <p>
            So, how can we escape the suffering these little bits of grasping and<br/>
            attachment cause? Simply being mindful that they exist in the first place.<br/>
            Maintaining a vigilance for the phrase “should have,” a desire for things<br/>
            to be different than they really are at this moment, is the first step of<br/>
            letting go of these non-realities. It is then that we can meet what is face<br/>
            to face and truly live in the present.
