Hello, it looks like you are recruiting me for a job at your company. 

I am not interested at this time, because:

[ ] I am happy in my current role
[ ] this job does not appear to be in an area I feel I am likely to be successful
[ ] this job would require moving
[ ] I used to work there and didn’t have a positive experience
[ ] I have friends and/or colleagues that have worked there and they didn’t have positive things to say
[ ] I have read things which make me wary of working at your company
[ ] I have concerns about working under your leadership

Furthermore, I:

[ ] already applied previously and was rejected
    [ ] and I am not interested in applying again because I don’t have reason to believe the interview loop would reach a different outcome
[ ] already applied previously and declined your offer

I could possibly still be persuaded if:

[ ] you offered an obscene amount of money
[ ] the job was in a fun, tropical location 

Furthermore, your pitch would be stronger if:

[ ] this role was not for a more junior position than I currently hold
     [ ] and previously held at your company
[ ] you acknowledged the fact that I used to work there
[ ] you didn’t start by asking me to complete an automated coding assessment
[ ] you spelled my name correctly (I mean, it’s right there in the email address)      

In conclusion:
[ ] this is not the right time, but I may be interested in the future
[ ] please unsubscribe me from your list

Cheers,

Aleks
